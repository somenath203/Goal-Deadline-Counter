# Goal-Deadline-Counter

This is a basic Web App created with the help of html, css and javascript where the user can basically add the name of the goal the user wants to achieve with a countdown timer. The user can also reset the goal at any point of time while the countdown is in progress and after the countdown has ended for a particular goal, the user can start a brand new goal deadline.

This counter also has the feature of local storage means if the user refreshes thr page after the countdown has started or closes the website and then, again repoens it, then the countdown will continue as it.
